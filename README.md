# The Embedded Store #

This project is a miniature version of an e-commerce website for selling robotics components. Features of the site include login/logout, forgot password option with a password reset email feature, account information updations, customer feedback via email, and cart features including adding/removing items from the cart, knowing the total cost of items in cart, etc. <br/>
