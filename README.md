# The Embedded Store #

This project is actually a miniature version of an e-commerce website for selling robotics components. It was started by me out of self-interest but went on to complete it as my database project included in our curriculum. Features of the site include login/logout, forgot password option with password reset email feature, account information updation, customer feedback via email and cart features including adding/removing items from cart, knowing the total cost of items in cart etc. <br/>

HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap and JavaScript were used to develop the front end and Django was used for the back end with SQLite as the database. <br/>
